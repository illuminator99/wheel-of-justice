# wheel-of-justice
A Wii-mote playable game about the criminal (in)justice system

Made in collaboration with the NYCLU for their Fix Public Defense campaign and based on their original JavaScript game (www.wheelofjustice.org)

Use a Wii-mote or the keyboard to spin a wheel which will land on a slice, telling the tale of a real
New Yorker, who was unfortunate enough to be poor and thus represented by an overburdened public defender
